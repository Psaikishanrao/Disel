## Backend Setup
The backend server uses Node.js and MongoDB and is deployed on Render. To connect the frontend with the backend:

Ensure your MongoDB instance is running or connected through a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.
The backend API is already deployed on Render at [https://disel-1.onrender.com]. This handles the database interactions and API requests.
