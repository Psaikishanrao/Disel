## To use this project

- [Fork it in your repository](https://github.com/Ankit-saw07/bugbuster)
- [Clone it in your local folder using https/ssh link](https://github.com/Ankit-saw07/bugbuster.git)

- The backend server is built using Node.js and MongoDB, and it is deployed on Render.

## Steps to set up the project locally

### Clone the repository:
1. Create a new folder on your system.
2. Open the folder in VS Code and run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ankit-saw07/bugbuster.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd bugbuster
   ```
4. Install all dependencies for the React app:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the React app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Backend Setup
The backend server uses Node.js and MongoDB and is deployed on Render. To connect the frontend with the backend:

1. Ensure your MongoDB instance is running or connected through a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.
2. The backend API is already deployed on Render at [your-backend-render-url]. This handles the database interactions and API requests.
   
No need for local JSON server anymore!

## Steps for working with Git:

1. To create your own branch:
   ```bash
   git branch branch-name
   ```
2. Switch to your branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout branch-name
   ```
3. To check branches:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
4. To commit and push changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "message"
   git push origin branch-name
   ```
5. In case of errors, you can revert to uncommitted code:
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```
